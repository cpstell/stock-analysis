# Stock-Analysis

Repository address: https://github.com/cpstell/stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

To analyze twelve stocks Steve's parents were thinking about investing in and to 
give his parents the information needed to make the correct decision. The code was 
refactored in an attempt to make it run quicker and more efficient.

## Results

After the code was refactored it ran faster due to a simpler command structure
which requires less proccesoing power to operate. The results can be seen below
with the reduction in times. Overall the difference is a few milliseconds between 
the original code and the refactored code which is a huge benefit.
